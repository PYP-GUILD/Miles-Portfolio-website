# Miles-Portfolio-website
Hi, I’m Miles — a passionate young developer building my future one project at a time.
I love creating clean, responsive websites that look good on every device.
JavaScript, HTML, and CSS are the tools I use to bring ideas to life.
I enjoy solving problems and learning new technologies every single day.
Right now, I’m exploring JavaScript DOM, animations, and interactive UI design.
I’m also learning robotics and Python to combine software with real-world machines.
I work on projects that challenge me to think differently and grow my skills.
Most of my code is built from scratch, focusing on simplicity and performance.
I believe in improving a little every day, no matter how small the step.
My goal is to build real-world apps that help people and make life easier.
I love experimenting with layouts, grids, and responsive design techniques.
I’m always working on new ideas and polishing old projects to make them better.
I take feedback seriously and use it to level up my work.
I enjoy collaborating with others and learning from their experiences.
I’m building a strong foundation in web development and software engineering.
Soon, I’ll expand into cybersecurity, backend development, and robotics hardware.
I document everything I learn so I never stop improving.
Every project here represents a step in my journey as a developer.
Thanks for checking out my work — more exciting projects are coming soon.
Let’s build something amazing together.
